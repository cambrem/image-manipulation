# Image Manipulation

This is an image manipulation program that takes an image you upload and gives you options to apply filters to the photo.

In order to run this program you will need to import OpenCV and Numpy. Whne you open the file, the import statements at the top of the file will have red lines under them. Click that and it will allow you to import the libraries. When you hover over cv2, make sure to download OpenCV-Python. This program is designed to be run in CLion, so you will also need to configure a python interpreter for the project.

When you run the program, the terminal will present you with a prompt to enter the file name of the image you want to be edited. If you don't enter a file name, it will automatically use a picture named "RallyCat.png". You will then be presented with options to edit the image. The first option, "Make color", allows you to tint the picture with the colors blue red green or orange. The second option, "Blur", gives you the option to blur the image four different ways. Finally, the last option is to sharpen the image. When one of these options are chosen, the original image and the edited image will both pop up on your desktop. The images are closed and the program ends once the escape key is pressed.
